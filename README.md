[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is a set of coding challenges that takes place every year during December. One challenge is released everyday until the Dec. 25th, and each challenge has 2 parts.

Both puzzles in one challenge have the same input.

These puzzles are thought-provoking and require problem solving skills. Challenges can be solved using variety of different programming languages.
